# final_project

This project has as goal answering to the question: 'will Italians still shop in physical stores
 after the pandemics of 2020 is over?", using open sources, which are:

- Google Mobility dataset.
- Wikipedia for an historical outline.
- WeatherBit for climatic conditions checking.

The final conclussion of this study was that the Italian population shows a tendency to going
to their pre-lockdown habits, so therefore, yes, the would go back to buy on physical stores
after the sanitary crisis ends. However, the data also show noticeable changes in their 
behavioural patterns, that suggest a decrease in general spending in leisure. In thi regard,
a second remark could be that e-commerce might grow if it presents itself as a cheaper
alternative for the consumers.

More detailed report will ensue in the following days as the git gets updated.
